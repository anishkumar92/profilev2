                <p class="pop-in">
                    With over 9 years of front-end development experience, I specialize in creating
                    innovative, accessible, and performant web applications. My journey has led me
                    through diverse industries, from banking to healthcare, where I've consistently
                    delivered high-quality code that stands the test of time.
                </p>
                <p class="pop-in">
                    My expertise in Angular and other modern web technologies has been honed through
                    collaboration with major companies like Infosys, Cognizant, and L&T Infotech.
                    I am not just about code; I am about building experiences that users love and
                    clients rave about.
                </p>
                <p class="pop-in">
                    I believe in sharing knowledge and have contributed to the broader web community
                    through writing and mentorship, helping others grow their skills just as I have
                    grown mine.
